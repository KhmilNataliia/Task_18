the logig(rules) of implementation of game-model:
!1! the abilities of personages to walk, fly or both fly and walk mean that some of them can fight with personages of concrete type, or not:
personages who can walk(ork,troll) can fight with personages who can walk too, or both walk and fly;
personages who can fly (elph) can fight with personages who can fly too, or both walk and fly;
personages who can both walk and fly(pegas,garpy,vampire,witch) can fight with all the types of characters;
!2! some additional rules:
personages can't fight with other personages of the same type(meaning that ork can't fight with ork for example), exept witches(they can fight with each other)
pegas and garpy are friend races, so they don't fight each other
trolls are slaves of witches, so they don't attack witches, but witches can attack trolls
